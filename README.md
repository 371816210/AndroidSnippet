# Android Snippet

Some code snippet for android.

#Usage

Make sure you declare the JCenter repository in your project's `build.gradle`:

    repositories {
        jcenter()
    }

Then add a compile-time dependency on this library, adding the `dependencies` section to `build.gradle` if it doesn't already exist:

    dependencies {
        compile 'com.githang:androidsnippet:0.1'
    }
